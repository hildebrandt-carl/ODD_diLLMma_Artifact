# OpenPilot Setup Guide

This guide includes folders for each of the [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) installation guide. Specifically we have listed the two versions of [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) we used below:


## Working Versions

* [2022_04](./2022_04/README.md) - This contains the installation guide for version `0.8.14` from a commit in April 2022.
* [2023_03](./2023_03/README.md) - This contains the installation guide for version `0.9.2` from a commit in March 2023. 

## Outcome

Both of these will result in working version of openpilot running on an Ubuntu 20.04 machine. They will both take in video and output steering angle, as seen below. See each of the readme's for more information:
