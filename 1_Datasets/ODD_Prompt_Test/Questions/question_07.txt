Visibility Impairment Due to Weather Conditions: "Does the image indicate visibility is significantly reduced due to rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions, challenging the vehicle's sensor accuracy?" [YES/NO]
Sensor Obstruction Detection: "Is there evidence of mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive materials obstructing the camera or sensors, potentially impairing the vehicle's environmental perception?" [YES/NO]
Identification of Sharp Curves: "Can you confirm if the road ahead in the image presents a sharp curve that would necessitate the vehicle's advanced handling and speed adjustment capabilities?" [YES/NO]
On-Off Ramp Navigation: "Does the image show the vehicle approaching or navigating an on-off ramp, requiring precise merging and speed control by the vehicle's automated system?" [YES/NO]
Intersection Presence: "Is there an intersection visible in the image that would demand the vehicle's sophisticated decision-making algorithms for timing and right-of-way assessment?" [YES/NO]
Restricted Lane Usage: "Are there designated lanes such as bus or bicycle lanes present in the image, requiring the vehicle's compliance with lane usage regulations?" [YES/NO]
Construction Zone Awareness: "Does the image depict a construction zone, necessitating the vehicle's adjustment to lane closures, altered traffic patterns, and reduced speed limits?" [YES/NO]
Challenge from Bright Lighting Conditions: "Is the vehicle exposed to extreme lighting conditions in the image, such as direct sunlight or oncoming headlights, which could challenge the vehicle's sensor systems?" [YES/NO]
Narrow and Winding Road Adaptation: "Does the image reveal a narrow and winding road ahead, requiring the vehicle's enhanced maneuvering and stability control systems to maintain safe operation?" [YES/NO]
Hilly Terrain Navigation: "Is the vehicle operating in hilly terrain as shown in the image, engaging the vehicle's power management and braking systems more intensively?" [YES/NO]
